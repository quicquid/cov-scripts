Some evaluation scripts regarding COVID
===========

* deaths.ml: each point corresponds to the deaths (y-axis) in the week (x-axis) of a particular year.
  We have data from 2000 to 2020, so there are 21 dots for each week. The dots for 2020 have been coloured red and
  are connected by lines to make them more visible. There are two areas where 2020 differs from the years before:
  weeks 12-18 (March / April) and weeks 42-50 (October to November) (there is no official data for the last two weeks of 2020 available yet).
  
  The data does not attribute the deaths to a particular reason but the difference to other years is clearly visible.
